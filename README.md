# Advanced Malware Generator Tool

## Overview

The Advanced Malware Generator Tool is designed for educational and defensive testing purposes. This tool helps generate various types of malware scripts to test and improve your security measures. The scripts simulate common malware behaviors, including keylogging, ransomware, network communication, screen capture, file stealing, and browser data extraction.

## Features

1. **Keylogger**: Logs keystrokes locally and with HTTP exfiltration.
2. **Ransomware**: Encrypts files using Fernet and AES with ransom notes.
3. **Network Communicator**: Uses simple socket connections and HTTP protocols.
4. **Screen Capture**: Captures screenshots at regular intervals and sends them via FTP.
5. **File Stealer**: Steals files based on directories and uses DNS tunneling for exfiltration.
6. **Browser Data Extractor**: Extracts browser data, including history, bookmarks, and cookies.
